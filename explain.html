            Purification aims to make the water safe for consumption and compliant with regulatory standards.
        </p>

            <h3>1. Coagulation and Flocculation</h3>
        <p>In this step, chemicals are added to the water to cause small particles to clump together into larger particles called floc. This helps to remove impurities and sediment from the water.</p>

            <h3>2. Sedimentation</h3>
        <p>The water is then allowed to sit in large tanks, allowing the heavier floc particles to settle to the bottom. This process is called sedimentation. The clear water above the settled particles is then ready for the next treatment step.</p>

        <h2 id="water-filtering">Filtering of the water</h2>
        <p>
            Filtering the water aims to remove impurities and improve its clarity and taste.
            Different types of filters, such as activated carbon filters or reverse osmosis membranes, can be used for this purpose.
            The water is passed through these filters, which trap and remove particles, sediment, and other impurities.
        </p>
        
        <h3> Filtration</h3>
        <p>The water passes through various filters, such as sand filters, activated carbon filters, or membrane filters. These filters remove smaller particles, bacteria, and other contaminants from the water.</p>
        <p>
            As part of the treatment process, water is subjected to filtration to remove any remaining suspended particles, sediments, or debris.
